            <h3>Here's a time line of Caparezza's life and music career:</h3>

            <ul class="timeline">
                <li><strong>1973</strong> - Caparezza ("Curly hair" in Apulian dialect, Michele
                    Salvemini's artist name) was born in Molfetta, in the region of 
                    Apulia.
                </li>
                <li><strong>1995</strong> - Attended to the the Young Talents of Sanremo festival 
                    with the artist name of Mikimix.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2000</strong> - Released his first album <i>?!</i> as Caparezza where he refuses the songs 
                    he made under the stage name of Mikimix.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2003</strong> - Second album <i>Verit√† supposte</i> (Supposed Truths) is out. He talks
                    about the social problems of Italian society, particularly the Southern one, the entertainment
                    in clubs and TV program with <i>Sono fuori dal tunnel</i> (I'm out of the tunnel) and racism
                    with <i>Io vengo dalla Luna</i> (I come from the moon).
                </li>
                <li><strong>2006</strong> - Released <i>Habemus Capam</i> which deals with the contradictions of society 
                    and the marginalization of a teenage boy in which Caparezza identifies himself 
                    with <i>La mia parte intollerante</i> (My Intolerant Side).
                </li>
                <li><strong>2008</strong> - <i>Le dimensioni del mio caos</i> (The Size of my Chaos) is the fourth 
                    Caparezza's studio album where he discusses environmental issues about his region and security issues
                    on the workplace with <i>Eroe, Storia di Luigi delle Bicocche</i> (Hero, History of Luigi delle Bicocche).
                    <br>
                    In the same year, he published a book entitled <i>Saghe mentali</i> (Mind Saga) in which describes his
                    discography in a humorous way.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2011</strong> - The fifth studio album <i>Il sogno eretico</i> (The Heretic Dream) is out. 
                    With this album he wants to involve his listeners to leave the dogma behind them and embrace
                    critical thinking. <i>Goodbye Malinconia</i> deserves attention for its collaboration with Tony Hadley of
                    Spandau Ballet and the issue of people fleeing abroad to look for a job and a better future.</li>
                <li><strong>2014</strong> - <i>Museica</i> is the sixth album whose name is composed by three words:
                    <i>musica</i> (music), <i>museo</i> (museum) and <i>sei</i> (six). He uses art as a way to escape from the
                    violence of the world and portrays the songs as a museum.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong> - Discovers to have the tinnitus which will influence the creation of 
                    following album.
                </li>
                <li><strong>2017</strong> - After going through a depression period, he made <i>Prisoner 709</i> which 
                    is a completely different artwork from the previous ones. The dark-themed environment dominates him and
                    the tracks and gives room to issues like the self-emprisonment of the mind.</li>
                <li><strong>2021</strong> - Last album <i>Exuvia</i> is considered the sequel of Prisoner 709, because 
                    he underlines the escape from the mental prison
                </li>                
            </ul>
